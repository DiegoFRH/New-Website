            Oh, na, oh
            Just shoot for the stars, if it feels right
            Then aim for my heart, if you feel like
            And take me away
            And make it okay
            I swear, I'll behave
            You wanted control, so we waited
            I put on a show, now we're naked
            You say, I'm a kid
            My ego is big
            I don't give a shit
            And it goes like this
            (Ah) take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
            (Ah) kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
            All the moves like Jagger
            I've got the moves like Jagger
            I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger
            (Ah) I don't need try to control you
            (Ah) look into my eyes, and I'll own you
            With them the moves like Jagger
            I've got the moves like Jagger
            I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger
            Baby, it's hard when you feel like
            You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
            But when you're with me
            I'll make you believe
            That I've got the key
            Oh, so get in the car, you can ride it
            Wherever you want, get inside it
            And you want to steer
            But I'm shifting gears
            I'll take it from here
            Oh, yeah, yeah, and it goes like this
            (Ah) take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
            (Ah) kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
            All the moves like Jagger
            I've got the moves like Jagger
            I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger (woo)
            (Ah) I don't need try to control you (oh, yeah)
            (Ah) look into my eyes, and I'll own you
            With them the moves like Jagger
            I've got the moves like Jagger (yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I've got the moo-oo-oo-ooves like Jagger
            (Uh) you wanna know how to make me smile
            Take control, own me just for the night
            And if I share my secret
            You're gonna have to keep it
            Nobody else can see this
            (Uh) so watch and learn, I won't show you twice
            Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right yeah
            And if I share my secret
            You're gonna have to keep it
            Nobody else can see this (ay-yeah-yeah-yeah)
            And it goes like this
            (Ah) take me by the tongue, and I'll know you (take me by the tongue)
            (Ah) kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you (yeah, yeah)
